### HashMapConcurrentModificationExample
ConcurrentModificationException may occur because HashMap doesn't support concurrent access during iteration and modification.

### ConcurrentModificationExceptionFix
ConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe and avoids the exception using internal locks for segments of the map,
but result is undefined 

### SynchronizedMapFix
This wrapper adds synchronized blocks to HashMap operations but doesn't fully prevent concurrent modification during iteration.
That's why explicit synchronization is needed

### ThreadSafeMap
synchronized methods

**All examples above ensures thread-safety but does not prevent data races**
